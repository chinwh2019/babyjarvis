Special tip when making smoothies, finely cut and freeze the fruits and vegetables (if using spinach-lightly stew soften the spinach then freeze until ready for use-and if making sorbet, use a small to medium sized food processor) that you plan to use that way you can avoid adding so much ice if at all-when making your smoothie.
