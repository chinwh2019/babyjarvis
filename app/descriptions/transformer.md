# Understanding the Transformer Neural Models for NLP

We will discuss how data is prepared and processed for these models, focusing on three key areas: input processing, the embedding layer, and position embeddings.

## Input Processing

The first step in machine learning is processing input data. In our case, we're using a transformer model to complete dialogues, specifically from the Game of Thrones series. However, computers don't understand English language directly. We have to convert the text into a format they understand - numbers and matrices.

The process begins by creating a vocabulary dictionary from all the words in our training data. Every word gets a unique numeric index, and the indices corresponding to the words in the input text are fed into the transformer model. For the purpose of this explanation, we denote these indices with the letter X.

## The Embedding Layer

Next, the inputs pass through the embedding layer, where each word in our vocabulary has a corresponding vector. Initially filled with random numbers, these vectors get updated during the training phase to better assist the model in its tasks. These vectors, known as word embeddings, are multi-dimensional representations of words, capturing various linguistic features.

The model itself decides the features during training, which could relate to the word's function (verb, entity, etc.). The graphical representation of these embeddings in a hyperspace shows how similar words move closer together during training. The embedding layer then selects the appropriate embeddings for the input text, denoted as E.

## Position Embeddings

While transformers can process all embeddings at once, making them faster than their sequential counterparts like LSTMs, they lose word order information. The solution is to introduce a new set of vectors, called position embeddings, which add word order awareness to word embeddings.

Position embeddings use wave frequencies to capture position information, which helps overcome the limitation of distorting embedding information or varying position embeddings based on sentence length. The original transformer paper introduced an approach that uses a combination of sine and cosine curves to generate these position embeddings.

To wrap up, the input words get converted into word embeddings by the embedding layer. We then add position information to these embeddings to get position-aware word embeddings. 

## Multi-Head Attention: A Comprehensive Breakdown

Now, we're ready to dive into the most important and complex component of transformer neural networks: the multi-headed attention layer.

## The Need for Attention

Consider this sentence: "She faced her enemies and whispered, Drakadis." If asked which Game of Thrones character this sentence refers to, your attention naturally gravitates towards the word "Drakadis." This is because your mind doesn't pay equal attention to all words, rather it focuses on the important ones. This is the crux of the attention mechanism in neural networks - it helps the model focus on significant words in a sentence. The transformer, however, takes it a step further with self-attention, where it considers the relationships among words within the same sentence. This is crucial for understanding the context of a word, especially when it has multiple meanings.

## Inside the Multi-Head Attention Layer

The multi-head attention layer consists of three linear layers: the query, key, and value layers. These serve to map inputs onto outputs and change the dimensions of the inputs. The same position aware word embedding is fed into these three layers. While this may seem counterintuitive given that queries, keys, and values are distinct in retrieval systems, it's important to remember that we're dealing with self-attention here.

These linear layers output the query, key, and value matrices. The query and key matrices are used to compute the attention scores, which indicate how much attention each word pays to other words in the sentence. These scores are then scaled and squashed using a softmax function, producing the final attention filter.

## The Role of the Value Matrix

While the attention filter plays a significant role, the value matrix is also crucial. It represents the original embedding information. When you multiply the attention filter with the value matrix, you get a filtered value matrix, which assigns high focus to the more important features. Essentially, the attention filter helps to eliminate unnecessary details, allowing the model to focus on what matters most.

## Why Multi-Head?

So far, we've dealt with a single attention head. However, in practice, transformers utilize multiple attention heads, each focusing on different linguistic phenomena. This is similar to how we might pay attention to different aspects of an image, such as the main subject and the background.

In the original transformers paper, the authors used eight attention heads, but we'll stick to three for this explanation. Each attention head produces its own attention filter and filtered value matrix, each focusing on a different combination of linguistic features.

The final output of the multi-head attention layer is obtained by concatenating the outputs of all the attention heads and passing them through a linear layer to shrink their size.

## In Conclusion

The multi-headed attention layer is a powerful tool that has propelled transformers to the forefront of the NLP field. Its ability to focus on important words and consider the relationships between words in a sentence has revolutionized how we approach language processing tasks.

## From Residual Connections to Masking Modules

The final section of the deep dive into the workings of transformer neural networks, where we explore the fascinating components of residual connections, layer normalization, the decoder module, and the mass attention module.

## Residual Connections: The Knowledge Preservation Highway

A neural network consists of multiple layers of neurons. As information passes through these layers, some potentially important knowledge may get lost. The solution? Residual connections. Think of them as information highways that circumvent many intermediate layers and directly feed information to deeper layers. By combining this information with the output of the intermediate layers, we ensure that deeper layers do not forget important information presented early in the system.

## Add and Norm Layer: Balancing the Outputs

The next step involves the 'add and norm' layer, which receives the outputs of the embedding layer and the multi-head attention component. It simply adds these inputs and then normalizes the result. This normalization involves standardizing neuron activations along feature axes, which essentially involves subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of neuron activations, thereby ensuring a balanced output.

## Unveiling the Transformer's Decoder Module

Much like the encoder, the decoder in a transformer network transforms vectorized representations into new text. However, unlike the encoder that takes only one input, the decoder takes two: the output of the encoder and the output text generated so far.

The output of the encoder is divided into two copies: credit and key copies. The generated text is passed through an output embedding layer, which converts it into an embedding vector. This vector then goes through a multi-head attention layer and an add norm layer, producing a value matrix which, along with the credit and key matrices from the encoder, are inputs to the decoder's second multi-head attention module.

The final linear layer in the decoder has as many units as there are classes in the classification task. In the case of text generation, every word is considered a class on its own. The output from this layer passes through a softmax layer, converting raw scores into probabilities, allowing us to pick the word with the highest probability for generation.

## The Magic of Masking in Training

During training, the model is provided with both the source dialogues and their target outputs. However, the target dialogues are masked to ensure the model learns to generate the next word in a sequence without having access to future words. This is similar to a teacher not revealing all the answers during a practice exam.

Masking operation involves adding negative infinity to all future words, effectively making their attention scores zero. During training, as each word is predicted, its corresponding true label is unmasked and fed to the decoder. This process, sometimes referred to as 'teacher forcing', helps the model learn from its mistakes and improve upon past predictions.

This comprehensive understanding of transformers and their components, from residual connections to masking modules, forms the foundation of powerful Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications. One such application is Hugging Face's GPT-2 model, which uses transformer-based architecture to generate text that complements a given dialogue, just like Cersei's witty completion to Ned Stark in Game of Thrones.

Understanding these intricate details of transformer neural networks has hopefully equipped you with the knowledge to embark on your own AI adventures. Congratulations on completing this deep dive into the world of transformers!
